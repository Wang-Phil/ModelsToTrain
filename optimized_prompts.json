This is a linear interface finding, distinct from the asymmetric joint space narrowing and focal, scalloped osteolytic lesions that characterize wear.",

    "Fracture": "There is discontinuity of the cortical bone surrounding the hip prosthesis with angulation or deformity, indicative of a periprosthetic fracture adjacent to the implant.",
    "Good Place": "A hip prosthesis with stable fixation and normal alignment. The adjacent bone shows uniform density with a smooth, continuous cortical interface. This contrasts sharply with the lucent lines, debris-induced osteolysis, and asymmetric narrowing seen in wear.",
    "Infection": "There is evidence of periprosthetic joint infection, suggested by findings such as irregular osteolysis, periosteal reaction, soft tissue swelling or fluid collections",
    "Native Hip": "This represents a native hip joint without prosthetic components, demonstrating normal osseous and joint anatomy.",
