{
  "Acetabular Loosening": "The acetabular cup shows signs of loosening, demonstrated by radiolucent lines, migration, or changes at the bone–implant interface.",
  "Dislocation": "The prosthetic hip joint has lost congruency, resulting in dislocation of the hip prosthesis with the femoral head displaced out of the acetabular cup.",
  "Fracture": "There is discontinuity of the cortical bone surrounding the hip prosthesis with angulation or deformity, indicative of a periprosthetic fracture adjacent to the implant.",
  "Good Place": "The hip prosthesis is in an appropriate position with proper alignment and no evidence of loosening, migration, or malposition.",
  "Native Hip": "This represents a native hip joint without prosthetic components, demonstrating normal osseous and joint anatomy.",
  "Spacer": "A temporary antibiotic spacer is present within the hip joint, typically used during staged revision arthroplasty to maintain space and deliver local antibiotics.",
  "Stem Loosening": "The femoral stem demonstrates signs of loosening, including radiolucent lines, subsidence, or migration along the bone–implant interface.",
  "Infection": "There is evidence of periprosthetic joint infection, suggested by findings such as irregular osteolysis, periosteal reaction, soft tissue swelling or fluid collections",
  "Wear": "Wear debris is present around the prosthetic components, accompanied by adjacent bone resorption or asymmetric joint space narrowing consistent with prosthesis wear and potential osteolysis."
