    "Acetabular Loosening": "The acetabular cup shows signs of loosening, demonstrated by radiolucent lines, migration, or changes at the bone–implant interface.",
    "Dislocation": "The prosthetic hip joint has lost congruency, resulting in dislocation of the hip prosthesis with the femoral head displaced out of the acetabular cup.",
    "Fracture": "There is discontinuity of the cortical bone surrounding the hip prosthesis with angulation or deformity, indicative of a periprosthetic fracture adjacent to the implant.",
    "Good Place": "A well-functioning hip prosthesis with symmetrical joint space and stable component fixation. The surrounding bone shows no signs of aggressive osteolysis, wear-induced scalloping, or particulate debris. Implant appears in a neutral, non-deforming position.",
    "Infection": "There is evidence of periprosthetic joint infection, suggested by findings such as irregular osteolysis, periosteal reaction, soft tissue swelling or fluid collections",
    "Native Hip": "This represents a native hip joint without prosthetic components, demonstrating normal osseous and joint anatomy.",
    "Spacer": "A temporary antibiotic spacer is present within the hip joint, typically used during staged revision arthroplasty to maintain space and deliver local antibiotics.",
    "Stem Loosening": "The femoral stem demonstrates signs of loosening, including radiolucent lines, subsidence, or migration along the bone–implant interface.",
    "Wear": "Wear debris is present around the prosthetic components, accompanied by adjacent bone resorption or asymmetric joint space narrowing consistent with prosthesis wear and potential osteolysis."
