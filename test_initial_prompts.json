  {
    "Acetabular Loosening": "The acetabular cup shows signs of loosening, demonstrated by radiolucent lines, migration, or changes at the bone–implant interface.",
    "Dislocation": "The prosthetic hip joint has lost congruency, resulting in dislocation of the hip prosthesis with the femoral head displaced out of the acetabular cup.",
    "Fracture": "There is discontinuity of the cortical bone surrounding the hip prosthesis with angulation or deformity, indicative of a periprosthetic fracture adjacent to the implant.",
    "Good Place": "A well-fixed hip prosthesis in anatomic alignment, characterized by uniform periprosthetic bone density, smooth cortical margins, and normal soft tissue planes—lacking the irregular osteolysis, periosteal reaction, or soft tissue swelling indicative of infection.",
    "Infection": "There is evidence of periprosthetic joint infection, suggested by findings such as irregular osteolysis, periosteal reaction, soft tissue swelling or fluid collections",
    "Native Hip": "This represents a native hip joint without prosthetic components, demonstrating normal osseous and joint anatomy.",
    "Spacer": "A temporary antibiotic spacer is present within the hip joint, typically used during staged revision arthroplasty to maintain space and deliver local antibiotics.",
    "Stem Loosening": "The femoral stem demonstrates signs of loosening, including radiolucent lines, subsidence, or migration along the bone–implant interface.",
    "Wear": "Wear debris is present around the prosthetic components, accompanied by adjacent bone resorption or asymmetric joint space narrowing consistent with prosthesis wear and potential osteolysis."
